    "question": "How do I store the breastmilk?",
    "answer": "Breastmilk can be stored at different temperatures, but each have a different time frame. For freshly pumped breastmilk, it can last up to 4 hours at room temperature, up to 4 days in the fridge, and up to 12 months in the freezer although using within 6 months is best. For thawed, previously frozen breastmilk, it can last at room temperature for 1-2 hours, in the fridge for 1 day and it should never be refrozen. Finally for breastmilk that is leftover from a feeding, the milk must be finished within 2 hours after the baby is finished, or else it must be pitched.",

    "question": "What are the benefits of breastmilk?",

According to the CDC, breastfed babies have a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes, and SIDS. They are also less likely to have ear infections and stomach bugs. The third benefit to breastfeeding is that breastmilk shares antibodies from the mother to her baby, which help the baby develop a stronger immune system.",
